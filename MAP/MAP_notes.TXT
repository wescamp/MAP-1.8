* There is a lot to do with this project. I am temporarly using default images for enemy sprites/protraits. I need someone to create custom sprites/images for me. I may design a few later on though. But for now, these will do.
* There is no difference with difficulty at the moment. I have yet to decide on what makes the game harder/easier. (Most likely, more enemies, bonus damage, etc...) Although, more on that in the future...
* finally fixed the teleporting location near the end of the game. I apologize for this not working from updating it twice... (i tested it myself. it works...)
